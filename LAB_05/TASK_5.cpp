/*Keeping in mind our previous car example, write a class that represents a car, and useaggregation and
composition to combine different components like engine, wheels, headlights and steering to create the
car object.

Hint: create the individual classes firstbeforeperforming the composition. Remember
thatfor aggregation, you will need pointers! Youâ€™ll be needing constructors and setters to
set these values in case of aggregation. Same hint applies to other questions.*/
